## notepage.

### share your markdown notes as html with tha world 😁😁😁

#### notepage turns markdown files into a complete HTML webpages with:

  - HTML5 doctype and structure
  - Meta tags for character encoding and mobile viewport
  - Inline CSS for basic styling (max-width, centered, system font)
  - Post title as both page title and main heading
  - Date and description in a paragraph
  - Main content area with the converted markdown

### what works: 
- markdown turns into cool html webpage

### what doesn't work
- a lot
- notes that don't start with a date in %Y-%m-%d format lol
- notes without toml frontmatter, example:

```m
  +++
  title = "README"
  description = "read me"
  +++
```

For my use case, converting obsidian notes into html, 
seems like it works pretty well!

However, .md files are expected to start with a date in %Y-%m-%d format,
which can be problematic as obviously not everyone structures their notes that way.

### Usage 
- contents/ for markdown files
- public/ for the converted html files

- configure template.rs to change the html output, and inline css
- configue config.toml to change page title and base url for all 'posts'
